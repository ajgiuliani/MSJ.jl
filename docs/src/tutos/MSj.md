# The MSj package
## Loading and plotting mass spectrometry data
This tutorial shows how to use how to import data and how to plot mass spectra.

## Extracting data from several files
This tutorial gives an example how to extract UV spectroscpy data from different files containing UV activation at different wavelengths.

## Isotopic distributions
Here we will calculate the isotopic distribution of a compound, simulate a mass spectrum from that distribution and compare this result to experimental data.
