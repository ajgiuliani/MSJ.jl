* ![Feature][badge-feature] `isotopic_distribution`: public function. Takes either the chemical formula or a dict{String,Int} and returns a set of isotopologues.

* ![Feature][badge-feature] `masses`: public function. Takes either the chemical formula or a dict{String,Int} and returns the average, nominal and isotopic masses.
* ![Feature][badge-feature] `simulate`: public function. From an isotpic distribution simulate a mass spectrum based on a resolution and a peak shape.

## Version `v0.2.0`
* ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] `msfilter` function is renamed `average`.
